# Work-day-planner

## Description
This planner gives typical 9-5 worker to implement their notes to keep track of what to do for the work hours.

## What was your motivation?
- I really wanted to utilize 3rd party API's.
- After learning about js from scratch, it was surprising to know that their were easier ways to code in js.

## Why did I build this project?
- As someone who likes to stay on schedule, I wanted to create an application where I can track my progress of what to do for the day.
- I built the interface to be as simple as possible and to visually see if the time has passed or not.

## What problem does it solve?
- I ran into using 3 party languages errors.
    - Because I got confortable with vanilla javascript, learning other formats to code was quite difficult to understand and implement.

## What did I learn?
- Overall, building this application was an amazing experience, and continually learning more js is always a good challenge for someone who wants to enter into the tech industry.
