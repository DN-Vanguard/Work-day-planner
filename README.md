HW5

## What was your motivation?
- This assignment is a cultivation of everything I learned so far.
- After learning about js from scratch, it was about time for me to combine my HTML and CSS skills, and create something that combines these 3 languages together.

## Why did I build this project?
- I use google forms frequently, and never really thought about how much work was put into something like that.
- Although mine is mediocore compared to google, I established a firm foundation on what is needed.
- Moving forward, I will always be thinking about the back-end side of things when looking at a website.

## What problem does it solve?
- Linking 2 html pages and js files was quite difficult in the beginning.
- Although I scoured the web, I didnt fully understand what I was seeing or reading. It wasnt until I had a tutoring session where I was able to speak with someone 1-on-1 to fully grasp linking multiple html and js files together.
- I needed more hands-on practice, and I am glad that I sought help rather than looking at something I did not understand.

## What did I learn?
- Javascript is still a hard language to learn. I have only scratched the surface, but I look forward to applying shortcuts such as jQuery. I was not able to use it for this project, but my next project can only get better!
- Also, pathing is a huge part of making sure the pages load properly on gitHub. Although my original pathing worked locally, pushing to the hub gave it a lot of trouble. "./" and "../" makes a HUGE difference.
